# Forecasting-Windspeed-at-Dogger-Bank
This project aims to predict wind speeds at Dogger Bank using historical weather data and time series analysis, combined with machine learning techniques. The dataset includes climate variables such as temperature, pressure, and humidity, which are used to model and forecast wind speeds.

Features:
Time Series Analysis: Utilizing sequential weather data to predict future wind speeds.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, reshaping data, and cleaning geographical data.
Wind Speed Calculation: Using U10 and V10 variables to compute wind speed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns, outliers, and distributions in wind speed data.
Machine Learning Models: Applying linear regression, multivariate analysis, and evaluating model performance on time series data.
Visualization: Boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots to analyze relationships between variables.
Tools Used:
R (for time series analysis, data preprocessing, and visualization)
Machine Learning algorithms for regression and prediction
